*A video processing framework with simplicity and backward compatibility in mind*

VapourSynth-Classic is a fork of VapourSynth R55 to provide long-term stable API:
If your vpy script works under VapourSynth R54, then it should continue to work for the foreseeable future.

We simply do not break vpy-level API.
